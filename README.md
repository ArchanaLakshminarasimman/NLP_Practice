# Practice of Basic NLP methods:

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical exploration using Python libraries.

## Objective

The goal is to:
- Understand the dataset's structure and content.
- Identify missing or duplicate data.
- Perform basic statistical analysis.
- Visualize relationships and distributions of data variables.

## Features

### 1. Data Import and Overview
- Load the dataset using `pandas`.
- Inspect the dataset for column names, data types, and missing values.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values through imputation or removal.
- Remove duplicates to ensure data integrity.

### 3. Exploratory Analysis
- Summary statistics for numerical and categorical columns.
- Visualizations using:
  - **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for histograms, boxplots, and pairplots.
  - **WordCloud** for text data insights.

### 4. Advanced Visualization
- Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.
- Distribution and trend analysis for continuous variables.
